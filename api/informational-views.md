# Informational Views

TimescaleDB makes complex database features like patitioning and data retention
easy to use with our comprehensive APIs. However, TimescaleDB works hard to 
provide detailed information about the state of your data, hypertables, chunks,
and any jobs or policies you have in place.

These views provide the data and statistics you need to keep track of your database.
